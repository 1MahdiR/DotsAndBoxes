# DotsAndBoxes
Hi...

This is a simple one-player "Dots and Boxes" game.

It uses a recursive function to calculate the reward it can get based on each turn and each move.

```calculate_reward_n_layer(edges, board_p:list, depth=0, turn=True, reward=0)```

You can change the game board size by editing ```WIDTH``` and ```HEIGHT``` constants in 'main.py'. You can also change the depth of the recursive function by editing ```DEPTH``` in 'board.py`.

It's not a learning algorithm. It's just calculation.
By default, this function calculates 5 moves ahead. It CAN calculate further moves but it requires a lot of time. Basically the code isn't optimized.

So I would appreciate any contribution you do to this project.

The game interface also has some work to do. It's not very user-friendly. It takes some time to get a hold of it.

But anyway...

I had fun writing this code. So I hope at least you'll find it useful.

Happy Hacking... :)
